You can access Delta tables from Apache Spark and [other data processing systems](https://delta.io/integrations/). Here is the list of integrations that enable you to access Delta tables from external data processing engines.

## Presto to Delta Lake integration

Since Presto [version 0.269](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.269/release/release-0.269.html#delta-lake-connector-changes), Presto natively supports reading Delta Lake tables. For details on using the native Delta Lake connector, see [Delta Lake Connector - Presto](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector/deltalake.html). For Presto versions [lower than 0.269](https://prestodb.io/docs/0.269/release/release-0.269.html#delta-lake-connector-changes), you can use the manifest-based approach detailed in [Presto, Trino, and Athena to Delta Lake integration using manifests](https://docs.delta.io/latest/presto-integration.html).

## Trino to Delta Lake integration

Since Trino version 373, Trino natively supports reading and writing the Delta Lake tables. For details on using the native Delta Lake connector, see Delta Lake Connector - Trino. For Trino versions lower than version 373, you can use the manifest-based approach detailed in Presto, Trino, and Athena to Delta Lake integration using manifests.

## StarRocks to Delta Lake integration

[StarRocks](http://starrocks.io), a Linux Foundation project, is a next-generation sub-second MPP OLAP database for full analytics scenarios, including multi-dimensional analytics, real-time analytics, and ad-hoc queries. StarRocks natively supports reading Delta Lake tables. For details, see [StarRocks Delta Lake External Catalog](https://docs.starrocks.io/en-us/latest/data_source/catalog/deltalake_catalog) support.
