Delta tables support a number of utility operations.

For many Delta Lake operations, you enable integration with Apache Spark DataSourceV2 and Catalog APIs (since 3.0) by setting configurations when you create a new `SparkSession`. See [Configure SparkSession](/latest/delta-batch/#configure-sparksession).

## Remove files no longer referenced by a Delta table

You can remove files no longer referenced by a Delta table and are older than the retention
threshold by running the `vacuum` command on the table. `vacuum` is not triggered automatically. The
default retention threshold for the files is 7 days. To change this behavior, see [Data retention](/latest/delta-batch/#data-retention).

<Info title="Important!" level="warning">

- `vacuum` removes all files from directories not managed by Delta Lake, ignoring directories beginning with _. If you are storing additional metadata like Structured Streaming checkpoints within a Delta table directory, use a directory name such as `_checkpoints`.

- `vacuum` deletes only data files, not log files. Log files are deleted automatically and asynchronously after checkpoint operations. The default retention period of log files is 30 days, configurable through the `delta.logRetentionDuration` property which you set with the `ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES SQL` method. See [Table properties](/latest/delta-batch/#table-properties).

- The ability to time travel back to a version older than the retention period is lost after running vacuum.

```sql
VACUUM eventsTable   -- vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

VACUUM '/data/events' -- vacuum files in path-based table

VACUUM delta.`/data/events/`

VACUUM delta.`/data/events/` RETAIN 100 HOURS  -- vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old

VACUUM eventsTable DRY RUN    -- do dry run to get the list of files to be deleted
````

```python
from delta.tables import *

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)  # path-based tables, or
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, tableName)    # Hive metastore-based tables

deltaTable.vacuum()        # vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

deltaTable.vacuum(100)     # vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old
````

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

deltaTable.vacuum()        // vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

deltaTable.vacuum(100)     // vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions;

DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable);

deltaTable.vacuum();        // vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

deltaTable.vacuum(100);     // vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old
```

</CodeTabs>

<Info title="Note" level="info">
When using `VACUUM`, to configure Spark to delete files in parallel (based on the number of shuffle partitions) set the session configuration `"spark.databricks.delta.vacuum.parallelDelete.enabled"` to `"true"`.
</Info>

See the [Delta Lake APIs](/latest/delta-apidoc) for Scala, Java, and Python syntax details.

<Info title="Warning" level="info">
It is recommended that you set a retention interval to be at least 7 days, because old snapshots and uncommitted files can still be in use by concurrent readers or writers to the table. If `VACUUM` cleans up active files, concurrent readers can fail or, worse, tables can be corrupted when `VACUUM` deletes files that have not yet been committed. You must choose an interval that is longer than the longest running concurrent transaction and the longest period that any stream can lag behind the most recent update to the table.
</Info>

Delta Lake has a safety check to prevent you from running a dangerous `VACUUM` command. If you are certain that there are no operations being performed on this table that take longer than the retention interval you plan to specify, you can turn off this safety check by setting the Spark configuration property `spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled` to `false`.

## Retrieve Delta table history

You can retrieve information on the operations, user, timestamp, and so on for each write to a Delta table
by running the `history` command. The operations are returned in reverse chronological order. By default table history is retained for 30 days.

<CodeTabs>
```sql
DESCRIBE HISTORY '/data/events/'          -- get the full history of the table

DESCRIBE HISTORY delta.`/data/events/`

DESCRIBE HISTORY '/data/events/' LIMIT 1 -- get the last operation only

DESCRIBE HISTORY eventsTable

````

```python
from delta.tables import *

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

fullHistoryDF = deltaTable.history()    # get the full history of the table

lastOperationDF = deltaTable.history(1) # get the last operation
````

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

val fullHistoryDF = deltaTable.history()    // get the full history of the table

val lastOperationDF = deltaTable.history(1) // get the last operation
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;

DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable);

DataFrame fullHistoryDF = deltaTable.history();       // get the full history of the table

DataFrame lastOperationDF = deltaTable.history(1);    // fetch the last operation on the DeltaTable
```

</CodeTabs>

See the [Delta Lake APIs](/latest/delta-apidoc) for Scala, Java, and Python syntax details.

### History schema

The output of the `history` operation has the following columns.

### Operation metrics keys

The `history` operation returns a collection of operations metrics in the `operationMetrics` column map.

The following table lists the map key definitions by operation.

| Operation                                                         | Metric Name            | Description                                                                    |

## Retrieve Delta table details

You can retrieve detailed information about a Delta table (for example, number of files, data size) using `DESCRIBE DETAIL`.

<CodeTabs>

```sql
DESCRIBE DETAIL '/data/events/'

DESCRIBE DETAIL eventsTable
```

```python
from delta.tables import *

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

detailDF = deltaTable.detail()
```

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

val detailDF = deltaTable.detail()
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;

DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable);

DataFrame detailDF = deltaTable.detail();
```

</CodeTabs>

See the [Delta Lake APIs](/latest/delta-apidoc) for Scala, Java, and Python syntax details.

## Generate a manifest file

You can a generate manifest file for a Delta table that can be used by other processing engines (that is, other than Apache Spark) to read the Delta table. For example, to generate a manifest file that can be used by Presto and Athena to read a Delta table, you run the following:

<CodeTabs>

```sql
GENERATE symlink_format_manifest FOR TABLE delta.`<path-to-delta-table>`
```

```python
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(<path-to-delta-table>)
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
```

```scala
val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(<path-to-delta-table>)
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
```

```java
DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(<path-to-delta-table>);
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest");
```

See [Configure SparkSession](/latest/delta-batch/#configure-sparksession) for the steps to enable support for SQL commands in Apache Spark.

## Convert a Parquet table to a Delta table

Convert a Parquet table to a Delta table in-place. This command lists all the files in the directory, creates a Delta Lake transaction log that tracks these files, and automatically infers the data schema by reading the footers of all Parquet files. If your data is partitioned, you must specify the schema of the partition columns as a DDL-formatted string (that is, `<column-name1> <type>, <column-name2> <type>, ...`).

By default, this command will collect per-file statistics (e.g. minimum and maximum values for each column). These statistics will be used at query time to provide faster queries. You can disable this statistics collection in the SQL API using `NO STATISTICS`.

<Info title="Note" level="info">

If a Parquet table was created by Structured Streaming, the listing of files can be avoided by using the `_spark_metadata` sub-directory as the source of truth for files contained in the table setting the SQL configuration `spark.databricks.delta.convert.useMetadataLog` to `true`.

```

</CodeTabs>

<Info title="Note" level="info">

Any file not tracked by Delta Lake is invisible and can be deleted when you run `vacuum`. You should avoid updating or appending data files during the conversion process. After the table is converted, make sure all writes go through Delta Lake.

</Info>

## Convert a Delta table to a Parquet table

You can easily convert a Delta table back to a Parquet table using the following steps:

1. If you have performed Delta Lake operations that can change the data files (for example, `delete` or `merge`), run [vacuum](#remove-files-no-longer-referenced-by-a-delta-table) with retention of 0 hours to delete all data files that do not belong to the latest version of the table.
2. Delete the `_delta_log` directory in the table directory.

## Restore a Delta table to an earlier state

You can restore a Delta table to its earlier state by using the `RESTORE` command. A Delta table internally maintains historic versions of the table that enable it to be restored to an earlier state. A version corresponding to the earlier state or a timestamp of when the earlier state was created are supported as options by the RE`STORE command.

<Info title="Important!" level="warning">

- You can restore an already restored table.
- Restoring a table to an older version where the data files were deleted manually or by `vacuum` will fail. Restoring to this version partially is still possible if `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles` is set to `true`.
- The timestamp format for restoring to an earlier state is `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. Providing only a date(`yyyy-MM-dd`) string is also supported.

</Info>

<CodeTabs>

```sql
RESTORE TABLE db.target_table TO VERSION AS OF <version>
RESTORE TABLE delta.`/data/target/` TO TIMESTAMP AS OF <timestamp>
```

```python
from delta.tables import *

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, <path-to-table>)  # path-based tables, or
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, <table-name>)    # Hive metastore-based tables

deltaTable.restoreToVersion(0) # restore table to oldest version

deltaTable.restoreToTimestamp('2019-02-14') # restore to a specific timestamp
```

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, <path-to-table>)
val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, <table-name>)

deltaTable.restoreToVersion(0) // restore table to oldest version

deltaTable.restoreToTimestamp("2019-02-14") // restore to a specific timestamp
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;

DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, <path-to-table>);
DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, <table-name>);

deltaTable.restoreToVersion(0) // restore table to oldest version

deltaTable.restoreToTimestamp("2019-02-14") // restore to a specific timestamp
```


</CodeTabs>

<Info title="Important!" level="warning">

Restore is considered a data-changing operation. Delta Lake log entries added by the RESTORE command contain dataChange set to true. If there is a downstream application, such as a Structured streaming job that processes the updates to a Delta Lake table, the data change log entries added by the restore operation are considered as new data updates, and processing them may result in duplicate data.

For example:

| Table Version | Operation | Delta Log updates | Records in data change log updates |
| - | - | - | - |
| 0 | `INSERT` | `AddFile(/path/to/file-1, dataChange = true)` | (name = Viktor, age = 29, (name = George, age = 55) |
| 1 | `INSERT` | `AddFile(/path/to/file-2, dataChange = true)` | (name = George, age = 39) |
| 2 | `OPTIMIZE` | `AddFile(/path/to/file-3, dataChange = false)`, `RemoveFile(/path/to/file-1)`, `RemoveFile(/path/to/file-2)` | (No records as Optimize compaction does not change the data in the table) |
| 3 | `RESTORE(version=1)` | `RemoveFile(/path/to/file-3)`, `AddFile(/path/to/file-1, dataChange = true)`, `AddFile(/path/to/file-2, dataChange = true)` | (name = Viktor, age = 29), (name = George, age = 55), (name = George, age = 39) |

In the preceding example, the `RESTORE` command results in updates that were already seen when reading the Delta table version 0 and 1. If a streaming query was reading this table, then these files will be considered as newly added data and will be processed again.

</Info>

### Restore Metrics

`RESTORE` reports the following metrics as a single row DataFrame once the operation is complete:

- `table_size_after_restore`: The size of the table after restoring.
- `num_of_files_after_restore`: The number of files in the table after restoring.
- `num_removed_files`: Number of files removed (logically deleted) from the table.
- `num_restored_files`: Number of files restored due to rolling back.
- `removed_files_size`: Total size in bytes of the files that are removed from the table.
- `restored_files_size`: Total size in bytes of the files that are restored.
