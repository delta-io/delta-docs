For most read and write operations on Delta tables, you can use Apache Spark reader and writer APIs. For examples, see [Table batch reads and writes](/latest/delta-batch) and [Table streaming reads and writes](/latest/delta-streaming).

However, there are some operations that are specific to Delta Lake and you must use Delta Lake APIs. For examples, see [Table utility commands](/latest/delta-utility).

<Info title="Note" level="info">
  Some Delta Lake APIs are still evolving and are indicated with the **Evolving**
  qualifier in the API docs.
