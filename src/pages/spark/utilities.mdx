Delta tables support a number of utility operations.

For many Delta Lake operations, you enable integration with Apache Spark DataSourceV2 and Catalog APIs (since 3.0) by setting configurations when you create a new `SparkSession`. See [sql support](https://delta.io/docs/spark/#sql-support).

## Remove files no longer referenced by a Delta table

You can remove files no longer referenced by a Delta table and are older than the retention
threshold by running the `vacuum` command on the table. `vacuum` is not triggered automatically. The
default retention threshold for the files is 7 days. To change this behavior, see [data retention](https://delta.io/docs/spark/batch#data-retention).

- `vacuum` deletes only data files, not log files. Log files are deleted automatically and asynchronously after checkpoint operations. The default retention period of log files is 30 days, configurable through the `delta.logRetentionDuration` property which you set with the `ALTER TABLE SET TBLPROPERTIES` SQL method. See [table properties](https://delta.io/docs/spark/batch#table-properties). - The ability to [time travel](https://delta.io/docs/spark/batch#deltatimetravel) back to a version older than the retention period is lost after running `vacuum`.

<CodeTabs>
```sql
VACUUM eventsTable   -- vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

VACUUM '/data/events' -- vacuum files in path-based table

VACUUM delta.`/data/events/`

VACUUM delta.`/data/events/` RETAIN 100 HOURS -- vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old

VACUUM eventsTable DRY RUN -- do dry run to get the list of files to be deleted

````

```python
from delta.tables import *

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)  # path-based tables, or
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forName(spark, tableName)    # Hive metastore-based tables

deltaTable.vacuum()        # vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

deltaTable.vacuum(100)     # vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old
````

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

deltaTable.vacuum()        // vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

deltaTable.vacuum(100)     // vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions;

DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable);

deltaTable.vacuum();        // vacuum files not required by versions older than the default retention period

deltaTable.vacuum(100);     // vacuum files not required by versions more than 100 hours old
```

</CodeTabs>

When using `VACUUM`, to configure Spark to delete files in parallel (based on the number of shuffle partitions) set the session configuration `"spark.databricks.delta.vacuum.parallelDelete.enabled"` to `"true"` .

See the [Delta API documentation](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-apidoc.html) for Scala, Java, and Python syntax details.

/shared/delta-retention-warning.md

Delta Lake has a safety check to prevent you from running a dangerous `VACUUM`
command. If you are certain that there are no operations being performed on
this table that take longer than the retention interval you plan to specify,
you can turn off this safety check by setting the Spark configuration property
`spark.databricks.delta.retentionDurationCheck.enabled` to `false`.

## Retrieve Delta table history

You can retrieve information on the operations, user, timestamp, and so on for each write to a Delta table
by running the `history` command. The operations are returned in reverse chronological order. By default table history is retained for 30 days.

<CodeTabs>
```sql
DESCRIBE HISTORY '/data/events/'          -- get the full history of the table

DESCRIBE HISTORY delta.`/data/events/`

DESCRIBE HISTORY '/data/events/' LIMIT 1 -- get the last operation only

DESCRIBE HISTORY eventsTable

````

```python
from delta.tables import *

deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

fullHistoryDF = deltaTable.history()    # get the full history of the table

lastOperationDF = deltaTable.history(1) # get the last operation
````

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)

val fullHistoryDF = deltaTable.history()    // get the full history of the table

val lastOperationDF = deltaTable.history(1) // get the last operation
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;

DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable);

DataFrame fullHistoryDF = deltaTable.history();       // get the full history of the table

DataFrame lastOperationDF = deltaTable.history(1);    // fetch the last operation on the DeltaTable
```

</CodeTabs>

See the [Delta API documentation](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-apidoc.html) for Scala/Java/Python syntax details.

### History schema

The output of the `history` operation has the following columns.

### Operation metrics keys

The `history` operation returns a collection of operations metrics in the `operationMetrics` column map.
The following table lists the map key definitions by operation.

## Retrieve Delta table details

You can retrieve detailed information about a Delta table (for example, number of files, data size) using `DESCRIBE DETAIL`.

```sql
DESCRIBE DETAIL '/data/events/'

DESCRIBE DETAIL eventsTable
```

## Generate a manifest file

You can a generate manifest file for a Delta table that can be used by other processing engines (that is, other than Apache Spark) to read the Delta table.

`sql GENERATE symlink_format_manifest FOR TABLE delta.` `<path-to-delta-table>`

See [sql support](https://delta.io/docs/spark/batch#sql-support) for the steps to enable support for SQL commands in Apache Spark.

<CodeTabs>
```python
deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(<path-to-delta-table>)
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
```

```scala
val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(<path-to-delta-table>)
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest")
```

```java
DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(<path-to-delta-table>);
deltaTable.generate("symlink_format_manifest");

## Convert a Parquet table to a Delta table

Convert a Parquet table to a Delta table in-place. This command lists all the files in the directory, creates a Delta Lake transaction log that tracks these files, and automatically infers the data schema by reading the footers of all Parquet files. If your data is partitioned, you must specify the schema of the partition columns as a DDL-formatted string (that is, `<column-name1> <type>, <column-name2> <type>, ...`).

If a Parquet table was created by Structured Streaming, the listing of files can be avoided by using the `_spark_metadata` sub-directory as the source of truth for files contained in the table setting the SQL configuration `spark.databricks.delta.convert.useMetadataLog` to `true`.

<CodeTabs>
```sql
-- Convert unpartitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>'
CONVERT TO DELTA parquet.`<path-to-table>`

-- Convert partitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>' and partitioned by integer columns named 'part' and 'part2'
CONVERT TO DELTA parquet.`<path-to-table>` PARTITIONED BY (part int, part2 int)

````

```python
from delta.tables import *

# Convert unpartitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>'
deltaTable = DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, "parquet.`<path-to-table>`")

# Convert partitioned parquet table at path '<path-to-table>' and partitioned by integer column named 'part'
partitionedDeltaTable = DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, "parquet.`<path-to-table>`", "part int")
````

```scala
import io.delta.tables._

// Convert unpartitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>'
val deltaTable = DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, "parquet.`<path-to-table>`")

// Convert partitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>' and partitioned by integer columns named 'part' and 'part2'
val partitionedDeltaTable = DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, "parquet.`<path-to-table>`", "part int, part2 int")
```

```java
import io.delta.tables.*;

// Convert unpartitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>'
DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, "parquet.`<path-to-table>`");

// Convert partitioned Parquet table at path '<path-to-table>' and partitioned by integer columns named 'part' and 'part2'
DeltaTable deltaTable = DeltaTable.convertToDelta(spark, "parquet.`<path-to-table>`", "part int, part2 int");
```

</CodeTabs>

Any file not tracked by Delta Lake is invisible and can be deleted when you run `vacuum`. You should avoid updating or appending data files during the conversion process. After the table is converted, make sure all writes go through Delta Lake.

## Convert a Delta table to a Parquet table

You can easily convert a Delta table back to a Parquet table using the following steps:

1. If you have performed Delta Lake operations that can change the data files (for example, `delete` or `merge`), run [vacuum](#delta-vacuum) with retention of 0 hours to delete all data files that do not belong to the latest version of the table.

#. Delete the `_delta_log` directory in the table directory.
