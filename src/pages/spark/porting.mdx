## Migrate workloads to Delta Lake

When you migrate workloads to Delta Lake, you should be aware of the
following simplifications and differences compared with the data sources
provided by Apache Spark and Apache Hive.

Delta Lake handles the following operations automatically, which you should
never perform manually:

- **`REFRESH TABLE`**: Delta tables always return the most up-to-date
  information, so there is no need to manually call `REFRESH TABLE` after
  changes.

- **Add and remove partitions**: Delta Lake automatically tracks the set of
  partitions present in a table and updates the list as data is added or
  removed. As a result, there is no need to run `ALTER TABLE [ADD|DROP] PARTITION` or `MSCK`.

- **Load a single partition**: As an optimization, you may sometimes directly
  load the partition of data you are interested in. For example,
  `spark.read.parquet("/data/date=2017-01-01")`. This is unnecessary with
  Delta Lake, since it can quickly read the list of files from the
  transaction log to find the relevant ones. If you are interested in a single
  partition, specify it using a `WHERE` clause. For example,
  `spark.read.delta("/data").where("date = '2017-01-01'")`. For large tables
  with many files in the partition, this can be much faster than loading a
  single partition (with direct partition path, or with `WHERE`) from a Parquet
  table because listing the files in the directory is often slower than reading
  the list of files from the transaction log.

When you port an existing application to Delta Lake, you should avoid the
following operations, which bypass the transaction log:

- **Manually modify data**: Delta Lake uses the transaction log to atomically
  commit changes to the table. Because the log is the source of truth, files
  that are written out but not added to the transaction log are not read by
  Spark. Similarly, even if you manually delete a file, a pointer to the file is
  still present in the transaction log. Instead of manually modifying files
  stored in a Delta table, always use the commands that are described in this
  guide.

- **External readers**: Directly reading the data stored in Delta Lake. For
  information on how to read Delta tables, see [\_](integrations.md).

- **External readers**: Directly reading the data stored in Delta Lake. For
  information on how to read Delta tables, see [\_](integrations.md).

- **External readers**: The data stored in Delta Lake is encoded as Parquet
  files. However, accessing these files using an external reader is not safe.
  You'll see duplicates and uncommitted data and the read may fail when someone
  runs [\_](delta-utility.md#delta-vacuum).

```
<Info title="Note" level="info">

Because the files are encoded in an open format, you always have the
option to move the files outside Delta Lake. At that point, you can run
`VACUUM RETAIN 0` and delete the transaction log. This leaves the table's files
in a consistent state that can be read by the external reader of your choice.

### Example

Suppose you have Parquet data stored in a directory named `/data-pipeline`, and
you want to create a Delta table named `events`.

The [first example](#save-as-delta-table) shows how to:

- Read the Parquet data from its original location, `/data-pipeline`, into a
  DataFrame.
- Save the DataFrame's contents in Delta format in a separate location,
  `/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/`.
- Create the `events` table based on that separate location,
  `/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/`.

The [second example](#convert-to-delta-table) shows how to use `CONVERT TO TABLE` to convert data from Parquet to Delta format without changing its
original location, `/data-pipeline/`.

Each of these examples create an [unmanaged
table](/data/tables.md#managed-and-unmanaged-tables), where you continue to
manage the data in its specified location. Databricks records the table's name
and its specified location in the metastore.

#### Save as Delta table

1. Read the Parquet data into a DataFrame and then save the DataFrame's contents
   to a new directory in `delta` format:

<CodeTabs>

```python
data = spark.read.parquet("/data-pipeline")
data.write.format("delta").save("/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/")
```

</CodeTabs>

#. Create a Delta table named `events` that refers to the files in the new
directory:

<CodeTabs>

```python
spark.sql("CREATE TABLE events USING DELTA LOCATION '/tmp/delta/data-pipeline/'")
```

</CodeTabs>

#### Convert to Delta table

You have three options for converting a Parquet table to a Delta table:

You have two options for converting a Parquet table to a Delta table:

- Convert files to Delta Lake format and then create a Delta table:

<CodeTabs>

```sql
CONVERT TO DELTA parquet.`/data-pipeline/`
CREATE TABLE events USING DELTA LOCATION '/data-pipeline/'
```

</CodeTabs>

- Create a Parquet table and then convert it to a Delta table:

<CodeTabs>

```sql
CREATE TABLE events USING PARQUET OPTIONS (path '/data-pipeline/')
CONVERT TO DELTA events
```

</CodeTabs>

- Convert a Parquet table to a Delta table:

<CodeTabs>

```sql
CONVERT TO DELTA events
```

</CodeTabs>

This assumes that the table named `events` is a Parquet table.

For details, see [\_](delta-utility.md#convert-to-delta).

## Migrate Delta Lake workloads to newer versions

This section discusses any changes that may be required in the user code when
migrating from older to newer versions of Delta Lake.

### Delta Lake 1.1 or below to Delta Lake 1.2 or above

The [LogStore](https://docs.delta.io/latest/api/java/index.html) related code is
extracted out from the `delta-core` Maven module into a new module
`delta-storage` as part of the issue
[#951](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/issues/951) for better code
manageability. This results in an additional JAR `delta-storage-<version>.jar`
dependency for `delta-core`. By default, the additional JAR is downloaded as
part of the `delta-core-<version>_<scala-version>.jar` dependency. In clusters
where there is _no internet connectivity_, `delta-storage-<version>.jar` cannot
be downloaded. It is advised to download the `delta-storage-<version>.jar`
manually and place it in the Java classpath.

### Delta Lake 1.0 or below to Delta Lake 1.1 or above

If the name of a partition column in a Delta table contains invalid characters
(` ,;{}()\n\t=`), you cannot read it in Delta Lake 1.1 and above, due to
[SPARK-36271](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36271). However, this
should be rare as you cannot create such tables by using Delta Lake 0.6 and
above. If you still have such legacy tables, you can overwrite your tables with
new valid column names by using Delta Lake 1.0 and below before upgrading

{" "}

Delta Lake to 1.1 and above, such as the following:

<CodeTabs>

```python
spark.read \
  .format("delta") \
  .load("/the/delta/table/path") \
  .withColumnRenamed("column name", "column-name") \
  .write \
  .format("delta") \
  .mode("overwrite") \
  .option("overwriteSchema", "true") \
  .save("/the/delta/table/path")
```

```scala
spark.read
  .format("delta")
  .load("/the/delta/table/path")
  .withColumnRenamed("column name", "column-name")
  .write
  .format("delta")
  .mode("overwrite")
  .option("overwriteSchema", "true")
  .save("/the/delta/table/path")
```

</CodeTabs>

### Delta Lake 0.6 or below to Delta Lake 0.7 or above

If you are using `DeltaTable` APIs in Scala, Java, or Python to
[update](delta-update.md) or [run utility operations](delta-utility.md) on them,
then you may have to add the following configurations when creating the
`SparkSession` used to perform those operations.

<CodeTabs>

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession \
  .builder \
  .appName("...") \
  .master("...") \
  .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension") \
  .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog") \
  .getOrCreate()
```

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

val spark = SparkSession
  .builder()
  .appName("...")
  .master("...")
  .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
  .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")
  .getOrCreate()
```

```java
import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;

SparkSession spark = SparkSession
  .builder()
  .appName("...")
  .master("...")
  .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension")
  .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog")
  .getOrCreate();
```

</CodeTabs>

Alternatively, you can add additional configurations when submitting you Spark
application using `spark-submit` or when starting `spark-shell`/`pyspark` by
specifying them as command line parameters.

```bash
spark-submit --conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"  ...
```

```bash
pyspark --conf "spark.sql.extensions=io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension" --conf "spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog"  ...
```
