<a id="table-version"></a>

The transaction log for a Delta table contains protocol versioning information
that supports Delta Lake evolution. Delta Lake tracks minimum [reader and writer
versions](/delta/delta-utility.md#detail-schema) separately.

Delta Lake guarantees _backward compatibility_. A higher protocol version of
the
Delta Lake reader is always able to read data that was written by a lower protocol
version.

Delta Lake will occasionally break _forward compatibility_. Lower protocol
versions of Delta Lake may not be able to read and write data that was
written by a higher protocol version of Delta Lake. If you try to read and
write to a table with a protocol version of Delta Lake that is too low,
you'll get an error telling you that you need to upgrade.

When creating a table, Delta Lake chooses the minimum required protocol version
based on table characteristics such as the schema or table properties. You can
also set the default protocol versions by setting the SQL configurations:

- `spark.databricks.delta.properties.defaults.minWriterVersion = 2` (default)
- `spark.databricks.delta.properties.defaults.minReaderVersion = 1` (default)

To upgrade a table to a newer protocol version, use the
`DeltaTable.upgradeTableProtocol` method:

<CodeTabs>
```sql
-- Upgrades the reader protocol version to 1 and the writer protocol version to 3.
ALTER TABLE <table_identifier> SET TBLPROPERTIES('delta.minReaderVersion' = '1', 'delta.minWriterVersion' = '3')
```

```python
from delta.tables import DeltaTable
delta = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "path_to_table") # or DeltaTable.forName
delta.upgradeTableProtocol(1, 3) # upgrades to readerVersion=1, writerVersion=3
```

```scala
import io.delta.tables.DeltaTable
val delta = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, "path_to_table") // or DeltaTable.forName
delta.upgradeTableProtocol(1, 3) // Upgrades to readerVersion=1, writerVersion=3
```

### Column mapping

[Column mapping
feature](https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md#column-mapping)
allows Delta table columns and the underlying Parquet file columns to use
different names. This enables Delta schema evolution operations such as [RENAME
COLUMN](/delta/delta-batch.md#rename-columns) on a Delta table without the need
to rewrite the underlying Parquet files. It also allows users to name Delta
table columns by using [characters that are not
allowed](/delta/delta-batch.md#special-chars-in-col-name) by Parquet, such as
spaces, so that users can directly ingest CSV or JSON data into Delta without
the need to rename columns due to previous character constraints.

Column mapping requires upgrading the Delta Lake table protocol.

<CodeTabs>
```sql
ALTER TABLE <table_name> SET TBLPROPERTIES (
   'delta.minReaderVersion' = '2',
   'delta.minWriterVersion' = '5',
   'delta.columnMapping.mode' = 'name'
)
```
</CodeTabs>

<Info title="Note" level="info">
  The Delta table protocol specifies two modes of column mapping, by `name` and
  by `id`. Currently in Delta Lake only the `name` mode is supported.
